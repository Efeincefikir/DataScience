

 I created an Streamlit app that recommends movies with two different filtering choices.

 There is two.IPYNB files for both filtering techniques, and one .py file for the streamlit app. 
 
 To run the app, Find the location of this file in command prompt, and run the operation:

 py -m streamlit run main.py

 Alternatively you can open the file in an IDE, and run the same code. Make sure all the files are in the same project.
